# to use the client library we have to import it

import agoclient

# we'll also use a background thread in this example

import threading
import time


# then we create an AgoConnection object. You need to specify an instance name as parameter. 
# This will be used to uniquely name the mappings file for internal id to uuid mapping and to identify the client devices ("handled-by" parameter)
# Examples for the instance name would be "zwave" for our z-wave device, "knx" for KNX, "owfs" for the one wire device, and so on.
# Just chose a name that is unique and speaks for itself. It is best practice to also use that instance name as section name in the config file
# if you need any config parameters.

client = agoclient.AgoConnection("example")


# the messageHandler method will be called by the client library when a message comes in that is destined for one of the child devices you're handling
# the first parameter is your internal id (all the mapping from ago control uuids to the internal ids is handled transparently for you)
# the second parameter is a dict with the message content

def messageHandler(internalid, content):
	if "command" in content:
		if content["command"] == "on":
			print "switching on: " + internalid

			# TODO: insert real stuff here, this is where you would do action and switch on your child device

			# depending on if the operation was successful, you want to report state back to ago control. We just send 255 in this case 
			# so that ago control changes the device state in the inventory to on

			client.emitEvent(internalid, "event.device.statechanged", "255", "")

		if content["command"] == "off":
			print "switching off: " + internalid
			client.emitEvent(internalid, "event.device.statechanged", "0", "")

# specify our message handler method
client.addHandler(messageHandler)


# if you need to fetch any settings from config.ini, use the getConfigOption call. The first parameter is the section name in the file (should be yor instance name)
# the second one is the parameter name, and the third one is the default value for the case when nothing is set in the config.ini

print agoclient.getConfigOption("example", "parameter", "0")


# of course you need to tell the client library about the devices you provide. The addDevice call expects a internal id and a device type (you can find all valid types
# in the schema.yaml configuration file). The internal id is whatever you're using in your code to distinct your devices. Or the pin number of some GPIO output. Or
# the IP of a networked device. Whatever fits your device specific stuff. The persistent translation to a ago control uuid will be done by the client library. The
# mapping is stored as a json file in CONFDIR/uuidmap/<instance name>.json
# you don't need to worry at all about this, when the messageHandler is called, you'll be passed the internalid for the device that you did specifiy when using addDevice()

# we add a switch and a dimmer 
client.addDevice("123", "dimmer")
client.addDevice("124", "switch")
# for our threading example in the next section we also add a binary sensor:
client.addDevice("125", "binarysensor")

# then we add a background thread. This is not required and just shows how to send events from a separate thread. This might be handy when you have to poll something
# in the background or need to handle some other communication. If you don't need one or if you want to keep things simple at the moment just skip this section.

class testEvent(threading.Thread):
    def __init__(self,):
        threading.Thread.__init__(self)    
    def run(self):
    	level = 0
        while (True):
			client.emitEvent("125", "event.security.sensortriggered", level, "")
			if (level == 0):
				level = 255
			else:
				level = 0
			time.sleep (5)
      
background = testEvent()
background.setDaemon(True)
background.start()


# now you should have added all devices, set up all your internal and device specific stuff, started everything like listener threads or whatever. The call to run()
# is blocking and will start the message handling
client.run()
